# 👋 Hello, I'm Chip

*Senior DevOps Engineer | SRE | Platform & Cloud Architect | AI Automation Enthusiast | Professional Bug Whisperer*

## 🎭 About Me

With 15+ years of turning coffee into infrastructure and teaching humans how not to break things in production, I've mastered the ancient art of keeping systems running while simultaneously explaining why we can't just "restart everything" to fix that one weird bug.

### 🔧 What I Do
- **DevOps Engineering**: Making deployments so smooth, they're practically frictionless
- **Site Reliability Engineering**: Keeping the lights on (and the alerts quiet)
- **Platform Engineering**: Building platforms so good, developers actually *want* to use them
- **Cloud Architecture**: Designing cloud solutions that scale better than my coffee addiction
- **AI-Powered Automation**: Applying AI agents to eliminate manual toil and optimize operations
- **Teaching**: Spreading the gospel of "Infrastructure as Code" and "No, we don't SSH into production"

## 🎓 Teaching Philosophy

*"The best infrastructure is the one you never have to think about, and the best teaching moment is right after something breaks in a spectacular fashion."*

I believe in:
- Learning through controlled explosions (in dev environments only!)
- Documentation so good, even future-you will understand it
- Automation so thorough, manual work becomes a distant memory
- Making complex concepts accessible without dumbing them down
